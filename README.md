# Systems_Analysis_Design_Project

Project Purpose: FOR ACADEMIC USE ONLY. This system is intended to be an online bookstore system, allowing users to browse and buy/sell new and used books along with allowing for 30 day invoicing of customers who are considered 'credit-worthy'. Additional Vendor Portal was added to allow large scale bookstore suppliers to provide product.


Built in NetBeans IDE 8.2 using GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1.1 and Java DB (Derby) Database 10.4 and later.

Feel free to edit this readme so we can keep track of all changes.<br />

Download note: Upon Download, JavaDB properties must be directed to the folder where the DOWNLOADED database is sitting. Default is a Derby Folder, and you can choose to copy the 'Bookstore' folder into that folder, or change the directory location in Netbeans under Services > JavaDB > *rightclick*> Properties > database location. The same goes for the Web_INF folder, which is located in the with the projects under Web Pages. Ensure the Web_INF folder is directing to the web.xml file downloaded, NOT the default web.xml file.
